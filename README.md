- Description: In this project, you are going to implement a single cycle CPU simulator called MiniCPU using C language. Your MiniCPU will demonstrate some functions of MIPS processors as well as the principle of the datapath and the control signals. MiniCPU should read in a file containing MIPS machine codes (in the format specified below) and simulate what the MIPS processor does cycle-by-cycle. AC file called component.c will be provided to you which implementing each component of the single-cycle datapath, you are required to modify and fill in the body of the functions in this file.
